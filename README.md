YAML is a great format, similar to JSON. It allows comments and flexibility in objects and arrays with regards to the elements. They can be inlined (`[ ... ]` and `{ ... }`) or line-by-line.

YAML isn't however as easy to work with programmatically as JSON.

This package offers an API and standalone executables to allow for modifying a YAML as JSON, and then applying that JSON diff as a patch on the YAML, preserving whitespace, comments and overall structure. This also makes the final YAML diff minimal.


# Versions

 * Version 2.0 requires Node 14


# API

This package exports three functions: `yamlPatch`, `yamlDiffPatch` and `yamlOverwrite`.


## yamlPatch

```ts
function yamlPatch( yaml: string, rfc6902: Array< Operation >, options?: ToStringOptions ): string;
```

This function applies `<rfc6902>` *"JSON Patch"* operations on a `<yaml>` while trying to preserve whitespace, comments and structure for a minimal change.

Returns the patched YAML.

You can use the [`rfc6902`][rfc6902-npm-url] package do create the patch object, or use `yamlDiffPatch` below.

> If the differences are too big, patching may fail (just like regular source code diff/patch operations). It's therefore recommended to - rather than re-using a JSON Patch for multiple different YAMLs - create the JSON Patch from each source YAML, transforming it as necessary and then apply that patch, whenever possible. That should never fail.


## yamlDiffPatch

```ts
function yamlDiffPatch( yaml: string, oldJson: any, newJson: any, options?: ToStringOptions ): string;
```

Uses two JSON's (`<oldJson>` and `<newJson>`) and makes a diff between them, then applies this as a patch to the `<yaml>`.

Returns the patched YAML.

This is the same as `yamlPatch( yaml, makeJsonPatch( oldJson, newJson ) );` where `makeJsonPatch` would create an RFC6902 patch object.


## yamlOverwrite

```ts
function yamlOverwrite( yaml: string, newJson: any, options?: ToStringOptions ): string;
```

Uses the source `<yaml>` as the source object and diffs that against `<newJson>`, then applies this diff as a patch to the `<yaml>`. This will overwrite the fields that are different, while maintaining the structure of the source YAML.

Returns the patched YAML.

This is the same as `yamlDiffPatch( yaml, yamlToJson( yaml ), newJson );` where `yamlToJson` would parse YAML into JSON.
